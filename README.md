# Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction
We perform EDA and implement various ML models to predict customer transaction in Kaggle competition <a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/overview">Santander Customer Transaction</a>.<br>
In this project, we explore:
<ol>
  <li> Correcting class imbalance with: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Upsampling technique like SMOTE </li>
    <li> Downsampling technique like Random Under Sampler </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Data reduction techniques. </li>
  <li> Machine learning and Deep learning models: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Random Forest </li>
    <li> Logistic Regression </li>
    <li> Neural Netwroks </li>
    <li> XG Boost </li>
    <li> Light GBM </li>
  </ul>
</ol>

A detailed report is also provided in this repo, comparing the approaches Random Forest and Logistic Regression.<br>
